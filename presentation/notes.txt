should mention why im using postgres instead of mysql
- postgres is a decent bit more popular than mysql in industry and i wanted to try it out
- https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies-database
- mention how mysql doesn't seem to have multirange equivalent, for example

potential problems
- role (level) is not a set value / user cannot have multiple roles
